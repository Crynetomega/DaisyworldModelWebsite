Daisyworld is a theoretical cloudless planet with negligible greenhouse gases where only black and white daisies live. The white ones have a higher albedo than the black ones. Together they regulate the climate on the planet

A website designed to enable people interested in climate modeling to understand the Daisyworld model.
